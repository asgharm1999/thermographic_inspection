This dataset consists 1050 Thermal InfraRed images and pixel annotations of 8 categories in urban scenes. The categories and the cooresponding labels are: 
road: 0
sidewalk: 1
Pedestrian: 2 
rider: 3 
vehicle: 4 
building: 5 
vegetation: 6 
sky: 7 
background: 8
Images are given in \Img8bit and annotation files are given in \gtFine
The dataset is divided into train/val/test sets. Numbers of the images in the three sets are 50/50/950.
